# React Tutorial

## Creation

Because [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) no longer works with React 19, I decided to update this tutorial to the [latest recommendation](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe).

I had to go to the sandbox, copy the code from there, and paste it here. It kind of works. There are deprecation notices and warnings, but it runs. I couldn't update the browser list because it would throw an error. Not the best experience, but good for teaching.

## Running the Project

```
npm run build
npm start
```
